Internal Handling of multiprocessing.Queue
This is where the "deep dive" happens. A multiprocessing.Queue isn't just a simple Python object; it's a proxy for a shared data structure managed by a separate background process or a shared memory segment.

Here's a simplified view of what happens when you create and use a multiprocessing.Queue:

Creation: When you call multiprocessing.Queue(), the multiprocessing module typically starts a manager process in the background. This manager process holds the actual queue object in its memory. Other processes will communicate with this manager.

Proxy Objects: The multiprocessing.Queue object you get in your main process is not the actual queue; it's a proxy object. This proxy object's methods (put, get, qsize, etc.) send instructions to the manager process.

The put() Operation:

A process calls q.put(item).

The item is first pickled (serialized into a byte string).

The proxy object sends this pickled byte string to the manager process.

The manager process receives the byte string and places it into the actual queue data structure it holds.

The get() Operation:

A process calls q.get().

The proxy object sends a request to the manager process.

The manager process checks its internal queue.

When an item is available, the manager retrieves it (the byte string) and sends it back to the requesting process.

The requesting process's proxy object unpickles (deserializes) the byte string back into the original Python object and returns it.

Why this approach? Because processes have separate memory spaces, they cannot directly access each other's variables. This client-server architecture with a central manager process and proxy objects allows them to safely and reliably share data.
