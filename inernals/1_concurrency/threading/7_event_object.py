"""

An Event object is a simple yet powerful synchronization primitive in Python's threading module. It acts as a signaling mechanism that allows one thread to notify other threads about a specific event. ðŸš© Its core function is to provide a way for threads to wait for a condition to become true without wasting CPU cycles by busy-waiting.

How It Works
An Event object has a single internal flag that can be in one of two states: True or False.

event.wait(timeout=None): This method blocks a thread until the internal flag is set to True.

If the flag is already True, the method returns immediately.

If the flag is False, the calling thread is put into a waiting state until another thread calls set().

An optional timeout argument can be provided to specify how long to wait before the method returns, even if the flag remains False.

event.set(): This method changes the internal flag to True. This wakes up all threads that are currently blocked on the wait() method. The flag remains True until another thread calls clear()
