Python's garbage collection is a multi-layered system designed to manage memory automatically. Its primary mechanism is **reference counting**, but it also employs a **cyclic garbage collector** to handle a specific, complex type of memory leak.

### 1. Reference Counting

Reference counting is the first and most fundamental form of garbage collection in Python. Every object in Python has a counter that keeps track of the number of references pointing to it. A reference can be a variable, an item in a list, a dictionary key, or an attribute of another object.

* **How it works**: When an object is created, its reference count is initialized to 1. Every time a new reference is made to the object (e.g., `b = a`), the counter is incremented. When a reference is destroyed (e.g., a variable goes out of scope or is deleted with `del`), the counter is decremented. .
* **Deallocation**: When an object's reference count drops to zero, it means it's no longer accessible from anywhere in the program. Python's memory manager immediately deallocates the memory occupied by that object.
* **Efficiency**: Reference counting is very efficient because the memory is reclaimed as soon as the object is no longer needed, without the need for a separate, time-consuming garbage collection process.

### 2. The Problem with Circular References

Reference counting works perfectly for most cases, but it fails to handle **circular references**. This is a situation where two or more objects refer to each other, forming a closed loop.

* **The Issue**: In a circular reference, even if the objects are no longer reachable by the rest of the program, their reference counts will never drop to zero because they are still pointing to each other. This creates a memory leak.
* **Example**: If `obj_a` points to `obj_b`, and `obj_b` points back to `obj_a`, and all external references to them are gone, they will remain in memory indefinitely. Their reference counts will stay at one, preventing deallocation.

### 3. The Cyclic Garbage Collector

To solve the circular reference problem, Python introduced a second garbage collector. This collector is also known as the **generational garbage collector**. It runs periodically and is designed to find and clean up unreachable cycles.

* **How it works**:
    * **Generations**: The collector divides all objects into three generations (0, 1, and 2). New objects are placed in generation 0. The longer an object survives, the higher its generation. The assumption is that most objects are short-lived.
    * **Collection Process**: The collector primarily focuses on generation 0. If an object survives a collection, it's promoted to the next generation. The collector runs less frequently on older generations.
    * **Cycle Detection**: The collector uses a graph-based algorithm to find cycles. It builds a graph of objects and their references. It then looks for objects that are part of a cycle but are not reachable from outside the cycle. Once such a cycle is found, the collector breaks the references within the cycle, allowing the objects' reference counts to drop to zero so they can be deallocated by the primary reference counting mechanism.

### Summary of the Hybrid Approach

Python's garbage collection is a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of two different techniques:

* **Reference Counting** handles the majority of memory management, providing immediate and efficient deallocation.
* **The Cyclic Garbage Collector** (generational GC) acts as a safety net, cleaning up memory leaks caused by circular references.
